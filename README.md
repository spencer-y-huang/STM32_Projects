Projects using the STM32 NUCLE-G070RB board.

using [a tutorial](https://kleinembedded.com/stm32-without-cubeide-part-1-the-bare-necessities/) 
from the Klein Embedded blog.

also looking at [this tutorial](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101) for some
additional conext - even though it's a different architecture/chip, it still covers the
low-level stuff
another [tutorial](https://vivonomicon.com/category/stm32_baremetal_examples/page/2/) - more data points aren't
bad, especially since I'm being insanely stubborn and not using CubeMX
