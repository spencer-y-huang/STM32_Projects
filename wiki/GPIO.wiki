### Input
pull-up resistor: set GPIO voltage to a higher voltage when not connected to something else
- high voltage source + resistor - source ensures high voltage, resistor
	prevents short circuit (resistor is usually ~10k ohms, voltage ~3V?)
	- larger resistor -> less responsive (because voltage takes longer to change)
floating: a state of undefined voltage. not great for trying to read input.
