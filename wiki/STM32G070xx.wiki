LQFP64 - pinout? so how it's connected to the board?

Address space is 4 GiB.
Bytes are little-endian.
* lowest byte = least significant.
* highest byte = most significant.
8 blocks of 512 MiB each.

### Flash
128 KB.
not sure what kind - NAND? Does it even matter?

### SRAM
SRAM can be 32KiB or 36KiB, depending on whether the parity check is enabled. It
loses 4 KiB because every byte gets one parity bit.
- parity checked on read, if it fails, a NMI interrupt is produced.
- if using the parity check, need to initialize the SRAM to 0 - otherwise, can
	get false-positive parity errors from non-initialized locations

### GPIO
the STM32G070xx also sets the _starting_ mode of the GPIO registers to
analog, after reset.
- this can be found on page 175, section 6.3.1 of the reference manual.

GPIOs are associated with PA, PB, PC, some bytes of PD and PF

### LED
LD4 is associated with GPIOA, PA5?
