to get gdb to work:

first set up an openocd connection.
`openocd -f interface/<interface>.cfg -f target/<target>.cfg`. 
it should say that it's starting a gdb server.

then start up `gdb-multiarch`.
`file <program>.elf` read the program file
`target extended-remote:<gdb port>` connect to the gdb server set up by openocd
`load` - loads the program

and then it's just gdb things!

note: preprocessor macros are pretty important - otherwise
you have to examine registers by raw memory address.
to get the compiler to pass them in debugging info, use the `-gdwarf-2 -g3`
flags.
