### Todo list
- [ ] refresh how a program is loaded and run again
	- [ ] explore linker script
	- [ ] explore startup code
- [ ] explore GPIO specifics
	- [ ] why does GPIOA act weird (and break) when I completely wipe GPIOA_MODER?
	- [ ] Why do I need to work with specifically the 10/11th bits in GPIOA_MODER?
