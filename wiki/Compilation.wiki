general flow:
source code -> COMPILER -> object files -> LINKER -> executable

what is an object file?
- the compiled file. (lol)
- usually, it's pure machine code.
- if you pass arguments to the COMPILER, you can get it to produce assembly.
	- this assembly can then be turned into machine code via an ASSEMBLER.
