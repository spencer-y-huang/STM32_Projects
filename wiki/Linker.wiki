### GENERAL
`.` is special - it refers to the current output location counter.
- since it refers to a location in an output section, must be in a statement in
	a SECTION command
- assigning to it _moves_ the current location counter
	- therefore, the statement `. = ALIGN(4);` moves the current location counter
		to be aligned with regards to next 4 byte boundary.

This [section](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC16)
describes the MEMORY and SECTION outputs.

### MEMORY
Only one MEMORY command per file.

In short, the MEMORY command allows you to tell the linker what parts
of memory it can use, and what parts it can't.

So 
```
MEMORY 
{
	FLASH (rx): ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 128K
	SRAM (rwx): ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 36K
}
```
tells the linker that there are two chunks of memory it can use.
* one is named FLASH, is read-only executable, starts at 0x08000000, and is 
	128KiB long.
* the other is named SRAM, is read-write executable, starts at 0x20000000, and 
	is 36KiB long.
	
(as an aside, flash vs SRAM)
SRAM: Static Random Access Memory
* fast (usually 4x faster than DRAM)
* expensive
* volatile, requires power to retain data (flip-flop circuit)
Flash:
* fast read, slower write
* cheap
* non-volatile

### SECTION
maps input sections to output sections
- placement in output section
- order in output file
- which output sections

Only one SECTION command per file. As many statements as you want.
statements can
- define entry point
- assign value to a symbol
- describe placement of named output section + input sections that go into it

```
SECTIONS
{
	.isr_vector :
	{
		KEEP(* (.isr_vector))
	} >FLASH
```

this is a section definition, specifying the properties of an output section.
- location
- alignment
- contents
- fill pattern
- target memory region

this particular output section is named `.isr_vector`.
`*(.isr_vector)` refers to the section called `.isr_vector` from the _input_ file.
- the `KEEP` symbol means "keep this section in the output even if it's not
	referenced anywhere."
		- why do we need this? Well... the `.isr_vector` is never used by the
			program itself - but it's used by the microcontroller! how else would 
			it know to find interrupts?

putting input sections into an output section copies? the data.

`>FLASH` is used in conjunction with the memory regions defined in the MEMORY command.
it states where the output section should end up.
